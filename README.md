# Ultra_QA Automation UI Task

This test automation framework is created as a solution for the `UI Automation task` of `Invent Analytics`. Test scenarios are written in `Gherkin language` according to the task. The codes are written in `Java` programming language with the implementations of `object-oriented-programming (OOP)` concepts. `Page object model (POM)` and `Singleton design pattern` are also implemented in the framework.

## About the framework

Codes are written as dynamic as possible to increase the `readability`, `re-usability` and `maintainability` of the framework. For example;

*The test is designed based on an `end-to-end (E2E)` scenario. All operations (`login`, `searching/adding/deleting a book`, `changing row number` and `logout`) are handled in this `E2E` scenario.
* `Google Chrome` is set as default browser, but it can be easily changed by updating `configuration.properties` file to achieve `cross-browser testing`,
* The website `url` to navigate, and `window size` can be updated through `configuration.properties` file as well,
* Step definition class is kept as clean as possible to increase the `maintainability`,
* The book that will be searched, added and deleted is again dynamically handled with the help of `Examples`,
* `Data driven testing` is implemented which means same tests will be executed against different book names, and this is achieved by `Scenario Outline - Examples` structure of `Cucumber`, 
* `username` and `password` inputs are provided dynamically via `configuration.properties` file
* The actual number of rows are retrieved from the webpage and compared with the expected `int` value which can be changed on the `feature` file,
* If the tests fail, the failed one/s will be executed once again to able `to minimize synchronization problems` with the help of `FailedTestRunner` class,
* `Screenshot` will be taken and stored under the `\target\` folder for the failed scenarios,
* `GitHub Actions` integration is done for `CI purposes`,
* The project can be triggered for each `push`, `pull request` etc for specific branch,
* Remote execution can scheduled as well (as `8.00 am` and `5.00 pm` `everyday` with a proper `cron` expression,
* `GitHub Actions workflow runs` can be reached from https://github.com/ratilgan/UltraTask/actions/workflows/maven.yml


## Reporting

Reports are generated by `Cucumber` automatically under `/target/default-html-reports` package. Beside that simple reporting, more detailed and fancy reporting is also used in the framework by adding `maven-cucumber-reporting` plug-in inside the `pom.xml` file. Those reports can be reached under `/target/cucumber-html-reports`. To able to get those fancy reports, the code should be executed through maven lifecyle or from the terminal with the command of `mvn verify`. In the case of test failures, a screen-shot of the related page is embedded into the report.

## Prequisites

* `Java 19 SDK` should be installed
* `IntelliJ IDE` (any IDE is fine) 
* `Maven` as buid management tool
* Browser drivers are fetching automatically from `bonigarcia` dependency, so no need to identify the browser version
